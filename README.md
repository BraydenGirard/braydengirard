### Hi there 👋

I'm currently working full time as the Digital Director at [Arctic Leaf](https://github.com/arcticleaf). I'm an Entrepreneur & Full-stack developer who likes to keep busy building cool stuff.

I have a Masters in Engineering, a BA in Comp Sci., and a minor in Business. Over the past 8 years I have worked as a developer, business owner, college educator, and tech lead. My education and experience has given me the competative advantage I bring to the table every day when working in tech! When I'm not working or building my next big idea, you will probably catch me doing one of the following:

- ⛵️ Out on the sailboat with family & friends
- 🏂 On the slopes
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Traveling with the family (or chasing the kids around the house)
- 🏒 Playing hockey
- 🕹 Gaming
- 🚴 Cycling
- 🚀 Falling down the crypto/nft rabbit hole

#### Incase you care:
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building Web3 projects!
- 💬 Ask me about solving web / app related tech problems
- 📫 How to reach me: [@braydengirard](https://twitter.com/braydengirard)
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm part owner in a small Maple Syrup production 🍁 🇨🇦
